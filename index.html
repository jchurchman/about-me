         <h3>BIO</h3>
            <p>Joe Churchman was born and raised in Southwest Washington. He grew up in a small town called Kalama, that embarrasingly touts itself as a "Twilight Location," because a few scenes for one of the movies were filmed there. When he's not learning how to code, Joe likes to brew his own beer, make jewelry, play with his two dogs, or just watch movies with his wife.</p>

         <h3>Work History</h3>
            <p>Joe used to work for his family's construction company--that's how he put himself through college. In 2011, Joe took a break from construction to see what else the world had to offer. Joe bounced around from working at Safeway, to a local Portland Bar, to an old trophy company (which was awesome) before going back to work for his family's construction company.</p>
